# NetFlipster

## Your goal

Are you ready to be the new **Netflipster**? Yes?
Then, let's go! But, brace yourself, hackers are coming!

## The app

The app is a simple command-line application.
It relies on an in-memory database.
Note: only the file named "Main" should be edited.


## Use cases

Time to go! As your PO, here are a set of use cases that should be implemented:

Example of output from command line of your application:
```
